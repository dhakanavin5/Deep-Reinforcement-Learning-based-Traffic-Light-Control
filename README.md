Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-based-Traffic-Light-Control
A dynamic and Intelligent Traffic Light Control System(DITLCS) is proposed which takes real-time traffic information as an input and dynamically adjusts the traffic light duration. The proposed DITLCS runs in three modes namely Fair Mode(FM), Priority Mode(PM), and Emergency Mode(EM). A deep reinforcement learning model is used to switch the traffic light in different phases (Red, Green, and Yellow) and the fuzzy inference system selects one mode among three modes i.e. FM, PM, and EM according to the Traffic Information.
